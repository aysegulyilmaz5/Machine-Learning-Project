# Machine-Learning-Project

The aim of this project is to:

Regression Analysis:

Load and preprocess the data.
Compare the performance of Linear Regression and XGBoost models.
Determine which model provides better predictions based on RMSE and R^2 metrics.
Clustering Analysis:

Load and preprocess the data.
Apply K-Means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms.
Evaluate their clustering performance.
Train an XGBoost classifier using the cluster labels and assess its classification performance.
Determine the most suitable clustering and classification approaches for the dataset.
